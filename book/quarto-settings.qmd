# Quarto settings

The settings of the Quarto book are compiled in a `_quarto.yml` file.
This file needs to be formatted very specifically; yaml files are very sensitive to incorrect indentation![^1]
Below is a template that you can use to get started with your Quarto book.

[^1]: Search online for "yaml validator" to check where your `_quarto.yml` is invalid if Quarto gives you an error in this file.

This `_quarto.yml` file is far from complete: the Quarto website has a full overview of [book options for the _quarto.yml](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html), information about the [book structure](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-structure.html) and fields for [customizing book output](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-output.html).
