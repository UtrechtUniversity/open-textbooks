# Adding multimedia

## Image

The basic markdown syntax for adding an image is as follows:

```md
![Image title](link/to/the/image.png)
```

The image can be located locally (in that case the link is the full path to the image file), or online (in that case the link is a URL to that picture).

For image positioning, styling, and more options, please check out [Quarto's documentation about figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html){target="_blank"}.

## Video

In Quarto, the basic syntax for embedding a video is as follows:

```md
{{< video link/to/video >}}
```

The video can be located locally (in that case the link is the full path to the video file), or online (in that case the link is a URL to the video).

For video options such as height, width, start time, etc. please check out [Quarto's documentation about videos](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html){target="_blank"}.

## Diagram

It's possible to create diagrams with markdown through the use of `mermaid` and other packages that are in-built in Quarto. See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html){target="_blank"} and the [mermaid website](http://mermaid.js.org/intro/){target="_blank"} for how to make this work.

## Audio

To be figured out. Audio players do not seem to be supported, this guy found some sort of workaround: <https://forum.posit.co/t/embed-sound-player-in-quarto-book/164739/7>
