# Working with git

The basic git workflow looks as follows:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
   a[make change] --> b[git add] --> c[git commit] --> d[git push]
```

1. Make an edit. For example in one of your chapters. Save the edit (`CNTR + S`)
2. Take a look whether git has recorded that you have made a change:
   a. Terminal:
         i. `git status` will list all the files which have been edited, but not committed.
         ii. `git diff YOURFILENAME` will display what content of your file has been changed.
   b. RStudio: 
      i. Click the Git tab on the top right of your screen. There, you will see which files have been edited, but not committed.
      ii. Select a file from the list in the Git tab, and click Diff to see what content of the file has been changed.
3. Commit the change
