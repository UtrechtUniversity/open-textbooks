# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

In this open textbook, we highlight some tips and tricks to set up and maintain an open textbook that is:

-   created with Quarto in Rstudio,
-   tracked by git, and
-   published on GitHub Pages

This book is not, nor will it ever be, complete. We include how to get started, and collect useful ways to customize a Quarto book to your liking. Contributions are welcome!

If you want to make a book hosted on GitHub with Jupyter Books (not with Quarto), the Delft University of Technology has made great materials available to make those: <https://interactivetextbooks.tudelft.nl/how-to-manual/> and <https://teachbooks.io/manual/>.
