# Getting started with a Quarto book

## Create a Quarto book

Follow the [Quickstart intstructions for Rstudio](https://quarto.org/docs/books/#quick-start) from the Quarto documentation to create an empty Quarto book.

## Basic settings

Open the `_quarto.yml` file. Make sure it at least contains something like this:

::: callout-note
This yaml should be validated, I don't think the indentation is correct at the moment
:::

``` yaml
project:
  type: book
  output-dir: ../docs           # When rendering, the html files will be 
                                # placed in the docs folder. The folder needs
                                # to be named docs in order for GitHub pages to work!

book:                           # Some general information about your book
  title: "[YOUR BOOK'S TITLE]"
  authors:                      # Book authors: add a new row for each new author
  - "NAME AUTHOR 1"
  - "NAME AUTHOR 2"
  
  date: "YYYY/MM/DD"            # Date of the book, you can also use 
                                # last-modified, or today (without quotes)
  
  chapters:                     # Table of contents
    - index.qmd                 # This is your landing page / homepage
    - YOUR-CHAPTER-1.qmd        # Make sure each chapter has its own .qmd file
    - part: NAME-PART           # Use part: if you want to add subchapters
      chapters:
        - YOUR-CHAPTER2.qmd
        - YOUR-CHAPTER3.qmd
    - YOUR-CHAPTER-4.qmd
    # etc.

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreport
```

See the [quarto-settings](#quarto-settings) chapter for more customization.

## Make your project a git repository

1.  git init in terminal
2.  commit all
3.  In GitHub, create an empty repository
4.  Copy code from GitHub into the RStudio terminal
5.  Practice the git workflow git add - git commit - git push and see the changes occur in the GitHub repo

## Host on GitHub pages

Turn on GitHub pages \> docs folder
